The return value of the String#upcase method is returned by the inner block to the inner call to Array#map;
this adds the uppercase string to a new array in place of the lowercase version.
This new array is returned by the outer block to the outer call to Array#map.
This call to map also creates a new array,
populated by the new inner arrays (containing the uppercase strings), which it then returns.
